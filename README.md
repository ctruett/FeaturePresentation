Feature Presentation
====================

This is a simple plugin to toggle everything around the currently selected text. The goal is to allow you to focus on a single bit of whatever document you are editing.

### Installation

You should have a Data/Packages folder in your Sublime Text install directory. All you need to do is download the plugin and put the plugin folder in the Packages folder.

### Keybindings

Feature Presentation is mapped to `f8` by default.
