Feature Presentation
====================

While working with a large document, sometimes I want to focus on a specific portion without any distractions. In the past, I would insert line breaks before and after the region I wanted to focus on, but that is both slow and sloppy.

Enter Feature Presentation.

This plugin allows you to focus on single portion of your document.  To activate Feature Presentation, select the portion of your document that you would like to isolate, and press the keyboard shortcut, which is bound to `f8` by default.

To return, simply close the window, and the changes will be applied to your update.

### Installation

Available on [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Feature%20Presentation)

### Keybindings

Feature Presentation is mapped to `f8` by default.
